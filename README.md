# UCD Resume
A basic resume for me to showcase my skills.

## Description
Put together as part of the Code Institutes User Centric Development project using HTML and CSS along with Bootstrap to create a resume. The original tutorial was for an imaginary person named Rosie but as I went along I used my own details and switched up some of the animations to be something which I felt was more visually appealing

## Roadmap
Currently it is still in a very basic form. I need to update my CV and my proficiencies (once I have finished the course and know what all of the languages are). Also, every student in the code institute will have done this so I will want to try and update the whole thing stylewise to make it more personal and to stand out more. I also want to reword a lot of it to make it more "me".

## Authors and acknowledgment
This project was made using bootstrap and with the aid of the video series hosted by the Code Institute and Matt Rudge in particular.
Other libraries used:
Font Awesome
Google Fonts
Hover.CSS

## Project status
Delopment is on hold whilst I finish the course though will almost certainly come back and use this as a template for my own CV page.
